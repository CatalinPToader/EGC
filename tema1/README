Repository of homework for the "Elements of Computer Graphics" course from UPB.
Built upon their framework: https://github.com/UPB-Graphics/gfx-framework 

Homework 1:

IMPORTANT: The map file needs to be in the same folder as the executable
           or the MAP_PATH_NAME define in tema1.cpp must be changed to its 
           location.
           If there's errors for namespace overwriting, you can safely
           delete the namespaces from the labs as mine have built upon
           them.

To enter the Map Editor, change the EDIT_MODE define in tema1.cpp
